== Introductions
* 2 - 4 participants

== Review of Architecture and use-case
* Desjardins will present and explain the architecture and use-case

== Review Questions
====
 In the context of heterogeneous cluster installation with deployment aware enable, does the job executors for each clusters will take jobs that belong to their deployment. (example : if I start a process instance of project A by the REST API cluster, does the thread execution will be on the cluster of project A? Thinking of the delegates that are only available on that cluster)

 Is there a spring boot starter that offers only the process engine without the REST API and the Webapp part?

 BPMN, DMN, CMMN, deployment will be done by using blue green deployment, this mean that models will be deployed as engine starting up. Do you have concern about this kind of deployment?

== Review Material

=== Architectural Considerations

##### Business transactions
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/user-guide/process-engine/transactions-in-processes/#wait-states

##### Data in process (source of truth for process and task data)
** Source of truth for process and task data
** https://camunda.com/best-practices/handling-data-in-processes/
** https://camunda.com/best-practices/enhancing-tasklists-with-business-data/

##### Implications on UI/UX
** Queries on tasks and processes?
** Where to aggregate calls/requests to make UI manageable?
** How to manage UX user experience? 

=== Code and Development
===== Delegates, task and execution listeners and code
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/user-guide/process-engine/delegation-code/
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/introduction/architecture/#camunda-bpm-platform-architecture

TIP: Should you execute code in the process/workflow execution context? What are other patterns for integration? External Tasks, Message Correlation

===== Other patterns
 * https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.14/user-guide/process-engine/external-tasks/#the-external-task-pattern
 * https://camunda.com/best-practices/routing-events-to-processes/#_hahahugoshortcode_20hbhb_using_the_strong_camunda_bpmn_framework_strong

=== Scaling and Operations

##### Clustering
** how deployment-aware works within a cluster??
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/user-guide/process-engine/the-job-executor/#job-execution-in-heterogeneous-clusters

##### Database in cluster
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/introduction/supported-environments/#databases
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/user-guide/process-engine/database
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/user-guide/process-engine/history/

##### Scaling considerations
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/user-guide/process-engine/history/
** https://camunda.com/best-practices/performance-tuning-camunda/
** Thourghput and Latency

#### Monitoring Jobs
** https://camunda.com/best-practices/operating-camunda/#_monitoring_strong_performance_strong_indicators

#### Multi-Tenancy
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.13/user-guide/process-engine/multi-tenancy

##### Governance
*** Disscuss the pros and cons of models deployed with Engine.
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.14/user-guide/process-engine/deployments/
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.14/reference/rest/deployment/post-deployment/
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.14/user-guide/process-engine/the-job-executor/#cluster-setups

=== Hands On
*** Configure and discuss implications of spring-boot starter without the REST API, webapps.
** https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.14/user-guide/spring-boot-integration/
** https://start.camunda.com/


== Success Criteria
* Recommendations
** Spring-boot project recomedations and example artifacts for deploying Engine without the REST API and the Webapp
*** Use the initalizer to create and build an artifact with the criteria needed
*** https://start.camunda.com/

** Knowledge transfer for architecture within heterogeneous cluster
** Knowledge transfer for model deployment

* Recordings of the sessions

////

== Dates for Architecture Workshop
* OCT 12th and 13th for 4 hours

== Future dates Architecture Review
* TBD - some time in November
* This will be an opportunity to digest info from Archtecture workshop, and also follow up with a workshop after some decisions are solidified

== Notes
** Org/Business can expose API's
** Org's own the deployments of engine, and devops,and process models/DMN's (Process family/Self service dev-ops)
** Where does the data-base live who owns it?
** Models are deployed with the engine in the project.
** Allow Org's to build flexible UI/UX
** PCF plastform
** TIPCO BPM - Virtualilzed Environment 30 biz products with several workflows
** Moving to on demand platform possibly Camunda
** Building platform around camunda
** Microservices running on PCF
** UI integration API
** architecture guidance to business line
** business line will have node and be able to create ORG

TODO: More about process archive and bpm-platform.xml. Get info from Chris
